# Linux-Learning-Blogs
As a freshman in my university, I was admitted into my universuty's robot team. The team's daily works are based on Ubuntu,a Linux-based OS(Operating System).But unfortunately, I know nothing about Linux before. So I write these blogs to record my progress in Linux learning and holp these blogs can help those who are also new in Linux.Don't worry about the disturbing and obscure terms , I will give accouts to every unfamiliar term. Also as I am a Chinese , so these blogs will based on Chainese, if I have the ability to write in English , I may translate all these blogs into English in the future. So start learning Linux with me.
